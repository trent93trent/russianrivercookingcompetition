                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Russian River Cooking Competition began in 2020 as a small gathering of local chefs in Sonoma County. What started as a friendly competition among colleagues has grown into one of Northern California's premier culinary events, attracting talent from across the West Coast.</p>
                <p>Named after the iconic Russian River that flows through the heart of wine country, our competition celebrates the rich agricultural bounty and culinary traditions of this unique region.</p>
